# KServe predictor extension for FuseML workflows

The Dockerfile and associated files in this folder implement the FuseML KServe predictor workflow step. The KServe predictor can be used to create and manage [KServe prediction services](https://kserve.github.io/website/) to serve input ML models as part of the execution of FuseML workflows.

For more information on what this workflow step does and how it can be used, see the [FuseML documentation](https://fuseml.github.io/docs/v0.3/workflows/kserve-predictor/).
