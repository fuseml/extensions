# Seldon Core predictor extension for FuseML workflows

The Dockerfile and associated files in this folder implement the FuseML Seldon Core predictor workflow step. The Seldon Core predictor can be used to create and manage [Seldon Core prediction services](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/) to serve input ML models as part of the execution of FuseML workflows.

For more information on what this workflow step does and how it can be used, see the [FuseML documentation](https://fuseml.github.io/docs/dev/workflows/seldon-core-predictor/).
